For a couple of years I was continuously capturing images of NYC skyline -- using a setup consisting of a raspberry pi, a cheap webcam, and a S3 bucket. This was mounted in an unglamorous neighborhood on upper east side in Manhattan, facing southwest (towards midtown). This was roughly based on <a href="https://nskyc.com/">NSKYC</a>.

I like to think that the summer humidity, endless construction hell, and the freezing winter is more apparent in my version, though :3
